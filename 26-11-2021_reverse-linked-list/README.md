## Reverse a Linked List - 26-Nov-21

### Given a Linked list with values, reverse the list so that the last value is now the head. Try to do this by mutating the given head value and not creating a new linked list as a copy of the original.

### This took me way longer than it needed to! Should of just used a while loop!
