## Remove the Islands - 25-Nov-21

### Given a 2D matrix of points either a 0 or 1, 1's are considered land and 0's are water, if a 1 is connected to the boundary of the matrix by 1's its considered mainland. If a 1 is surrounded by 0's (ignore the diagonals, just: up, down, left, right) then its an island and should be removed from the resulting matrix.
