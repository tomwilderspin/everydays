## Fibonacci - 27-Nov-21

### The Fibonacci sequence is constructed by adding the last two numbers of the sequence so far to get the next number in the sequence. The first and second numbers of the sequence are defined as 0 and 1. We get: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21â€¦ blah blah

### Write a function that returns the nth number of the sequence. This should be pretty easy. Your solution here may well be suitable for one of the next mini-challenges.

### Low on time today so have gone for a quick challenge... Woth a note: any higher than the 70's number in sequence will hit the limit of Int in JS(TS).
